# GitHub Enterprise SSO ID to Name (Firefox)

This is a rework of [iamkirkbater's Chrome plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamkirkbater/github-sso-to-name). I've rewritten the plugin using the WebExtensions API, it's tested on Firefox.

## Installation

Installation should happen from the [Add-ons for Firefox]() site.

## Configuration

Initial configuration is required for use. After installing and enabling the add-on open [Add-ons Manager](about:addons). You should see a "Preferences" button next to the add-on's name.

## About

This extension replaces a users' Enterprise ID with their name in GitHub Enterprise Edition.

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues or pull requests. I won't actively develop this, since it fits my needs, but I'm willing to look into any bugs or feature requests.

Also feel free to port this new version to Chrome or any other browser. I don't feel the need for this, since the original works well on Chrome.
